2.3 (patchlevel 1, December 2019)

(thanks Ralf Treinen)

2.3 (October 2019)

o Malformed file reading for files with content before the header now works

2.2 (2017)

o Keeps was_linearized flag with every loaded PDF

of the output pdf come from the same input pdf
o Pdfpagelabels bug fixes, especially to alphabetic labels
o Read StemV etc. values from the AFM header directly
o Object streams may be written uncompressed for manual inspection
o Recrypting overhauled. Now a first class citizen.

1.7 (30th August 2013)

o Support for writing with object streams
o AES256ISO encryption support
