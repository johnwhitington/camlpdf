(** {2 Encryption methods} *)

(** Encryption methods. The boolean for [AES128bit], [AES256bit] and
[AES256BitISO] indicates encryption of metadata or lack thereof.
AlreadyEncrypted is used as a flag to prevent garbage collection internally by
[pdf_to_file_recrypting]. *)

(** {2 Writing to outputs, channels and files.} *)

(** Write a PDF document to an [Pdfio.output], optionally encrypting and/or
linearizing. For now, linearization will not preserve object streams. If
[?preserve_objstm] is set (default is false), object streams which were in the
original file will be preserved. If [?create_objstm] is set (default is false),
additional new object streams will be created. To re-encrypt the file using its
existing encryption, provide the user or owner password in the [?recrypt]
argument. The unlabelled boolean argument is true if linearization is required.

on string length, this should be used only when the length of the output is
