(** Merge PDF files *)

(** Merge PDF files. [merge_pdfs retain_numbering remove_duplicate_fonts names
pdfs ranges] will merge the given PDFs. if [retain_numbering] is true, page
labels are retained. If [remove_duplicate_fonts] is true, duplicate fonts are
detected and coalesced. [names] is a list of strings the same length as the list
of PDFs. Equal names imply equal PDFs (for efficiency). [ranges] is a list of
page ranges. A page range is a list of pages to select, in order. For example
[[1]] or [[2; 2; 2; 5; 6; 7]].  *)

several documents from the same source. *)
